# keylogger.py

Simple Python keylogger written while working through the TCM Security Python course. It was used in my Bachelor's thesis ("Integrating information security in computer science education") to exemplify the skill/knowledge level necessary to write a basic hacking tool. It can very effectively be used as a school project for high school level students during an infosec or cyber threat awareness program.
